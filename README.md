Why robotframework -- 
              Robot is powerful open source tool for non-technical such as business analyst or POs who would like to see what requirements have been covered without knowledge of technical stuff. RobotFramework has built-in extensive libraries which pretty much cover all sorts of applications such as RPA, API, Database, Kafka, Operating system, SSH connections, XML, Json etc etc.
              POs or bussiness analyst also can write test cases using builtin keywords. Also, Test automation engineers can simplify these keywords using RobotFramework or Python language.
              Though RobotFramework mainly used for Acceptance testing it can be also used for application level testing with different approaches like Keyword driven, Behaviour driven and Data driven.
              
              
How to install Robot framework -
      - Install latest version of Python
      - Using Pip command install RobotFramework and its libraries such as Database, API etc
      - Any editor like Visual studio code, Atom, Pycharm or Notepad++ too
      - Install drive for any browser you want. I prefer, chrome always for best reception.
      That's it.
      
How Get_position.robot scripts desgined - 
   For End-to-End tetsing i have used behavioural driven approach which covers the flow which user performs and its implications.   
   I assumed Shypple website is available to access
   
   I would like to parametrize the position which use wants to search insteda of using hard coded calues in the test case. Usually, we use excel sheet to parametrize all our test data. But for this test i chose simple way.
